# Cemu-Skylanders-Emulated-Portal

This is an old build of Cemu (version 2.0 experimental from July 17, 2023) with an emulated Skylanders Portal of Power, implemented by deReeperJosh and compiled by TheBiemGamer.

## Improvements 

- No crashes on load when starting "SuperChargers" and "Imaginators."
- Emulated "Portal of Power" integrated into this build and works splendidly.
- The "controllerProfiles" folder includes bindings for the keyboard.
- The "graphicPacks" folder contains the "Cemu Graphic Packs: v914" specifically for Skylanders.
- The "NFC" folder includes the "Ultimate NFC Pack V5" in the SKY variant.
- The "ROMs" folder provides links and information on where to download Skylanders ROMs.
- The "keys.txt" file contains all the necessary keys to decrypt Skylanders ROMs.
- The "settings.xml file" contains pre-made settings for the Cemu emulator.

## Drawbacks

- Unfortunately, this older version does NOT support a physical Portal of Power. Despite all kind of attempts with Zadig, including black magic and manually re-writing USB drivers, the real portal won't be recognized.

- If you want to use a real portal, you can download the latest version of [Cemu Experimental](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases). In the latest version, a physical portal should work without the need of Zadig, just plug and play.

- However, be aware that with the latest version you might experience crashes when loading SuperChargers and Imaginators. This issue seems to stem from the original Cemu development, and despite multiple reports, no definitive fix has been found.
